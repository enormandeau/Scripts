"""Rename scaffolds using a correspondence file

Rename chromosomes to wanted names and then automatically rename shorter
contigs numerically by decreasing size.

Usage:
    <program> input_fasta correspondence min_length output_fasta

The correspondence file has two tab-separated columns with the prsent name on
the left and the wanted name on the right.

Scaffolds below min_length will be removed

WARNING: This version uses only the part of scaffold names before the first
space character.
